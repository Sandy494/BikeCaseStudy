  This is a project about identifying the factor affecting the Bike company sales/revenue.
- What is the background of your project?
  A linear regression model was implemented on the data to identify the facotrs impacting the bike company sales for the year 2018 & 2019. The company wanted to have a strategy built
  to improve its sales by understanding the various parameters and fine tune its strategy around the same
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  Idnetifying imported factore contributing to the sales of the rental bike company by using Linear Regression method.
- What is the dataset that is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Based on the final model, the top 3 features contributing towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes are temp(0.4680), Light Snow ( -0.2536) and wind speed (-0.1898). The data from 2019 also had a coefficient of (0.2314) but that is a historic dataset.
